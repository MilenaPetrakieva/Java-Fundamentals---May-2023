/*
Calculate how many courses will be needed to elevate n persons by using an elevator with a capacity of p persons.
The input holds two lines: the number of people n and the capacity p of the elevator.

You should divide n by p.
This gives you the number of full courses (e.g. 17 / 3 = 5).

• If n does not divide p without a remainder, you will need one additional partially full course (e.g. 17 % 3 = 2).
• Another approach is to round up n / p to the nearest integer (ceiling), e.g. 17/3 = 5.67 -> rounds up to 6.
• Sample code for the round-up calculation:

    int courses = (int) Math. ceil ((double) n / p);

        System.out.println(courses);
